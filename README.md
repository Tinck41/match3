# match3

This project was made simply for practice mostly in premake and some libs. However it is still a common match3 game and editor which you can install and play around, set youw own combination for match and whatever.

## Features
- Define combination for match
- Define the amount of different pieces

## Tech

match3 uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [EnTT] - EnTT is a header-only, tiny and easy to use library for game programming and much more written in modern C++.
- [SFML] - SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API.
- [spdlog] - Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.
- [ImGui] - Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++.
- [json] - Lib for serializing and deserializing json files in C++.
